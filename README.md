# Image-Processing-Project

This is an image processing project completed for Partial Differential Equations at Stockton University (MATH 4491)

This project focuses on:
  * removing noise from images
  * blurring images
  * de-blurring images

All of which are dependent on Partial Differential Equations. Methods include:
  * Heat Equation (to blur images)
  * Level-Set Method (to remove noise)
  * Modified Level-Set (to remove noise)
  * Shock Filter (to sharpen images)
